# EGES: Surrogate-assisted Efficient Grouping Evolutionary Search

This repository contains the **official implementation** of the algorithm presented in our paper:

> Huixiang Zhen, Wenyin Gong, Ling Wang, and Xiangyun Hu. "Surrogate-assisted Efficient Grouping Evolutionary Search for Expensive Large-Scale Multi-Objective Optimization", *IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation*, 2025 (Accepted).

## Repository Structure
- `/EGES` - The main MATLAB source code for our EGES algorithm.
- `/PlatEMO-master` - The [PlatEMO](https://github.com/BIMK/PlatEMO) framework, providing the operating environment.

## Contact
This MATLAB code was developed by [Huixiang Zhen](https://github.com/zhenhuixiang) from the School of Computer Science, China University of Geosciences.
